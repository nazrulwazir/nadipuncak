                    At the beginning of its establishment in March 2023, Nadi Puncak Sdn Bhd was more focused on civil work and telecommunications. However, with the experience and assets the company possesses, it has expanded its scope to include maintenance work and some TNB-related tasks based on past experience.

                <p>
                    Now, the scope of work within Nadi Puncak is divided into three main areas. Firstly, the company continues to focus on general telecommunications work, infrastructure, and civil works. Secondly, it includes general maintenance work such as landscaping, site cleaning, and more. Lastly, the company offers services related to TNB, transformer oil filtration, and the rental of lorries and backhoes upon request.

                <p>
                    This scope of work will continue to grow, making Nadi Puncak versatile and capable of adapting to the work assigned. Most importantly, the company is able to meet the specifications set by clients and main contractors.
